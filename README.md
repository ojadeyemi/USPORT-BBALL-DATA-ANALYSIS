## Basketball Team Data Web Scraping Project
This project focuses on web scraping data related to sports basketball teams using Python. The collected data is cleaned, organized into data frames, and stored in an SQLite database for further analysis.

### Project Overview

The main objectives of this project include:

- **Web scraping:** Utilizing Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and requests to extract data from various sources like basketball team websites, sports news sites, or official league pages. 

- **Data Cleaning:** Processing the scraped data to ensure consistency, accuracy, and relevance. This involves handling missing values, standardizing formats, and removing duplicates.

- **Database Integration:** Storing the cleaned data into a relational database (SQL) for efficient data management and retrieval.

- **Data Analysis:** Performing insightful analysis on the collected data. This could involve examining team performance, player statistics, game outcomes, and other relevant metrics.

- **Data Visualization:** Utilizing tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to create graphs, plots, and other visualizations that help convey stories or insights from the data analysis.
